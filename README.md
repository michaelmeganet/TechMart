Shopping cart application made in Java

<h2> <b>Note</b> </h2>

Application was created in Java using 'NetBeans'. This program was originally submited to the University of Greenwich
and was used as a submission for a coursework. All code is completely open-source but a reference to 'Milan Conhye' would be
much appriciated. This application uses 'Derby' to power the programs database and this library along with the drivers must be
installed in order to modify the database records.
